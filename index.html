          <h1>What is Graphics?üíªüñåÔ∏è</h1>
          <p>Graphics are visual images or designs on some surface, such as a wall, canvas, screen, paper, or stone, to inform, illustrate, or entertain.
             In contemporary usage, it includes a pictorial representation of data, as in design and manufacture, in typesetting and the graphic arts, and in educational and recreational software.
             Images that are generated by a computer are called computer graphics.</p>
           <h2>What is the use of Graphics?</h2>  
            <p>Graphics are visual elements often used to point readers and viewers to particular information.
             They are also used to supplement text in an effort to aid readers in their understanding of a particular
             concept or make the concept more clear or interesting.
             Graphics are commonly used in business and economics to create financial charts and tables.
             Advertising is one of the most profitable uses of graphics; artists often do advertising work.
