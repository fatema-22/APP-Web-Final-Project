              <p>Manual graphic design has its roots in the early history of mankind.  In order to meet their needs and create basic tools,
                 early humans painted the first pictures on the cave walls.  32,000 years ago is when the first cave paintings were created since early humans. 
                 Therefore, graphic art has existed since the dawn of time and is still used to produce new works, express emotions and exercise creativity.
                 Drawing, painting, printing on paper, metal printing and illustration are examples of hand graphics.
                 Manual graphics include: drawing, painting, caricature and photography.</p>
